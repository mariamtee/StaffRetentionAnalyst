**<ins>Recommendations:</ins>**

Based on the analysis, the following action steps are proposed

*1. Competitive Compensation :* Review and adjust compensation packages to ensure they are competitive within the industry, aiming to retain professionals.Based on the HR Data, more men are in employment in this company than women in all Departments, It is seen that more women are in part-time employments which on the surface may be seen as a Gender bias, but what's interesting is that the average Salary of the part-time female workers exceeds that of the full-time working men even though the men triple the part-time women by number.
To find a solution to these bias, we have to know if the majority of the female workers are agency or contract staff, if so the company can employ more full-time workers that are women, and invest in their training instead of paying so much for the part-time workers.The average age of the female in the company is 37, which MAY be a reason why their are not much full-time female in the company, could this be because of family life and kids? This has to be looked into, if the situation is true predicted then HR will need to hire females of a younger age bracket so that by the time they start having family life they're more balanced in their careers and are able to navigate both aspects without having to quit.

*2. Career Development:* 1632 staff exited for career growth,785 left for personal reasons, and 6 staff left for culture. From the data provided it is seen that  most staffs get promoted in a year or 2, staff are not leaving for career progression. The insight from the analysis shows that the majority of the staff that exit are from Engineering, Sales, and Research. These departments constitute the highest numbers of employees in the company but their Average Salary compared to the other departments is smaller, Staff in these departments are leaving because their income does not match their expertise,an interpretation of career growth by the employees in this context is tied to monetary compensation.

From the yearly progression of staff exit, the data shows that 2016 and 2020 were the years the exit number of staff was smallest, in 2016 the average salaries of Engineering, Sales and Research is higher when compared to 2017,2018,2019. In 2020 the average Salary increased but it's comparatively smaller than that of 2016.Only 52 staff exited the company in 2020 compared to almost a thousand exit in previous years.

**How can the company retain her professionals in Engineering, Sales, Research, and across the board?** 3. Minimize part-time staff across board as part-time staff earn more than full-time staff on average even-though the full -time staff double the part-time staff in number and increase the salary of full-time staff.Professional development of full-time staff; Implement training and skill enhancement programs to help employees grow in their roles and advance within the company.

*4. Restructuring:* the company needs to do a salary and staff restructuring of Departments like farm supervisor  and customer service as they're small in number and they earn higher than other departments that are 10 times their size in number.

*5. Performance monitoring & Professional development:* The company can let go of Engineers, salespersons and researchers with C appraisal and employ younger less experienced staff and invest in their training if increasing  the salaries of Engineers & salespeople is not financially feasible.


**Other recommendations.**

*Regular Feedback Mechanisms:* Establish regular channels for employee feedback and address concerns proactively to improve overall job satisfaction.

*Retention Metrics Monitoring:* Continuously track retention metrics and conduct periodic reviews to assess the effectiveness of implemented measures.

Retention Strategy: Develop targeted retention strategies for departments experiencing high talent loss, focusing on factors such as career growth, competitive compensation, and work-life balance.

Performance Management: Strengthen performance appraisal systems to provide employees with clear feedback, goals, and opportunities for improvement.
